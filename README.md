# RAD Education Website
by Keneila Hatch
[My Notes](notes.md)

A supplemental learning software website that provides resources for struggling students to help them learn subjects, when at full capacity. For the purposes of this course, the website will be a mockup of basic navigation, with only a small trivia game for a specific subject available as a resource. This is because I will not have the time to create multiple games and other useful resources. Parents register an account and then add children to it. They recieve updates on their children's work and can access their own resources to help their children. They can navigate between their children, with inividual updates and resources for each. Children, when they are logged in, can pick a subject and use the resources available. 


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

There are thousands of elementary-school aged children who struggle with school in various ways. RAD education provides resources for those students, such as fun trivia games, and lets you know how your children are doing and how you can better support their education process. 

### Design

![Design image](RADEducationDesign.JPG)

You start on the home page, and can navigate to About, Student Login, and Parent Login from there. The Login Page will also allow you to register if needed. Parents can navigate between their children, and, in the potential future, between updates view and parent resources view. They can register new children to their account. Only one of the course subjects is going to be available for Parents and Children for this class, with the other subjects being labeled as unavailable. The child view will mainly be a mockup where the only two available buttons are logout and a button to play the trivia game. The about page will be really simple, with a similar design to the home page. 

### Key features

- Login, logout, and register
- Parents recieve children's trivia scores, and can add more children to their account
- Trivia game, you answer by selecting one of the multiple choice buttons (updated question from outside source if I can find one)
- An about page describing the mission of the startup
- A homepage with a description of how the website works (if no trivia question source, an outside sourced picture will be on this page)

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - 7 different pages - Home page, About page, parent login/register, child login/register, Parent View, Child View, Trivia Game
- **CSS** - Appealing use of color and space, Easy to understand navigation design, Color telling you which answer was correct
